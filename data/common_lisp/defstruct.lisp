;;;; instances with ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;;
;;;; The CMU CL support for structures with ALTERNATE-METACLASS was a
;;;; fairly general extension embedded in the main DEFSTRUCT code, and
;;;; the result was an fairly impressive mess as ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;; extension mixed with ANSI CL generality (e.g. :TYPE and :INCLUDE)
;;;; and CMU CL implementation hairiness (esp. raw slots). This SBCL
;;;; version is much less ambitious, noticing that ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;; is only used to implement CONDITION, STANDARD-INSTANCE, and
;;;; GENERIC-FUNCTION, and defining a simple specialized
;;;; separate-from-DEFSTRUCT macro to provide only enough
;;;; functionality to support those.
;;;;
;;;; KLUDGE: The defining macro here is so specialized that it's ugly
;;;; in its own way. It also violates once-and-only-once by knowing
;;;; much about structures and layouts that is already known by the
;;;; main DEFSTRUCT macro. Hopefully it will go away presently
;;;; (perhaps when CL:CLASS and SB-PCL:CLASS meet) as per FIXME below.
;;;; -- WHN 2001-10-28
;;;;
;;;; FIXME: There seems to be no good reason to shoehorn CONDITION,
;;;; STANDARD-INSTANCE, and GENERIC-FUNCTION into mutated structures
;;;; instead of just implementing them as primitive objects. (This
;;;; reduced-functionality macro seems pretty close to the
;;;; functionality of !DEFINE-PRIMITIVE-OBJECT..)
