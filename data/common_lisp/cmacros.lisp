;;;; We often use a source-transform to do macro-like rewriting of an
;;;; ordinary function call. Source-transforms seem to pre-date the ANSI
;;;; specification and are redundant with compiler-macros.
;;;; In the interest of not multiplying entities needlessly, it should
;;;; be feasible to get rid of source-transforms.
;;;; A problem is namespace clobbering: these must not affect the host Lisp.

;;; A sanity-checker for an extremely common programmer error.
