;;;; PACKAGEs and stuff like that

;;;; Note: The code in this file signals many correctable errors. This
;;;; is not just an arbitrary aesthetic decision on the part of the
;;;; implementor -- many of these are specified by ANSI 11.1.1.2.5,
;;;; "Prevention of Name Conflicts in Packages":
;;;;   Within one package, any particular name can refer to at most one
;;;;   symbol. A name conflict is said to occur when there would be more
;;;;   than one candidate symbol. Any time a name conflict is about to
;;;;   occur, a correctable error is signaled.

;;;; FIXME: The code contains a lot of type declarations. Are they
;;;; all really necessary?

;;;; Thread safety
;;;;
;;;; ...this could still use work, but the basic idea is:
;;;;
;;;; *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK* is held via WITH-PACKAGE-GRAPH while working on
;;;; package graph, including package -> package links, and interning and
;;;; uninterning symbols.
;;;;
;;;; Hash-table lock on *PACKAGE-NAMES* is held via WITH-PACKAGE-NAMES while
;;;; frobbing name -> package associations.
;;;;
;;;; There should be no deadlocks due to ordering issues between these two, as
;;;; the latter is only held over operations guaranteed to terminate in finite
;;;; time.
;;;;
;;;; Errors may be signalled while holding on to the *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK*,
;;;; which can still lead to pretty damned inconvenient situations -- but
;;;; since FIND-PACKAGE, FIND-SYMBOL from other threads isn't blocked by this,
;;;; the situation isn't *quite* hopeless.
;;;;
;;;; A better long-term solution seems to be in splitting the granularity of
;;;; the *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK* down: for interning a per-package lock should be
;;;; sufficient, though interaction between parallel intern and use-package
;;;; needs to be considered with some care.

;;;  - thread 1 continues, and test for STRING= to NIL,

;;; but if the secondary return value mattered to the application,
;;; it is probably wrong. And of course if NIL was not intended to be found
;;; - as in a package that does not use CL - then finding NIL at all is wrong.
